First **write useful code** and make sure it works.\r\nfor example we write sayHello function in index.js file:\r\n\r\n        function sayHello(name) {\r\n    \t    alert('Hello ' + name)\r\n        }\r\n        export default sayHello\r\n\r\n 2. Initialize NPM by `npm init` command\r\n 3. Open package.json and add `\"main\": \"index.js\"`. this line means package main js file is index.js file.\r\n 4. (Optional) Test package locally. for test package in your local run `npm link` and then in your test project run `npm link your-package-name` and add it in package.json dependencies. after adding package to dependencies in your app import package and test it.\r\n 5. Signup in NPM if you have not account.\r\n 6. Signin to your account by running `npm login` command.\r\n 7. At least run `npm publish` to publish package.\r\n\r\n**Note: for each publish you should increase the version number in package.json.**\r\n\r\nThats it!"},"recentPosts":[{"id":1,"title":"Optional Chaining In JS Will Save Your Nerves","slug":"optional-chaining","summary":"What Is Optional Chaining And How Its Would Help You To Write Better Code","photo":"/images/optional-chaining.jpg","read_duration":5,"created_at":"2021-09-13","published_at":"2021-09-14"},{"id":2,"title":"How To Publish Package On NPM","slug":"how-to-publish-package-on-npm","summary":"How To Publish Your Utils On NPM","photo":"/images/how-to-publish-package-on-npm.png","read_duration":15,"created_at":"2021-10-18","published_at":"2021-10-18"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
